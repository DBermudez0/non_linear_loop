# nonlinear Loop Statements: Function-Defined Iteration Domains for Adaptive Control Flow
change loop by applying (if, else) conditional variable
Traditional loop constructs in programming languages—such as for, while, and do-while—assume linear or discrete iteration domains that are statically defined before execution. This limitation restricts the flexibility of control flow when modeling nonlinear or adaptive processes where the iteration domain depends dynamically on prior conditions or nonlinear functions.

We propose the concept of a Nonlinear Loop Statement (NLLS), a generalized form of the loop in which the iteration set or range is not fixed but defined by a function, conditional state, or nonlinear operator. For example, instead of iterating over a fixed linear vector, the NLLS allows dynamic, nonlinear, or context-dependent iteration domains defined as:non_linear_loop.m


In this form, the iteration variable i traverses a function-generated domain, rather than a pre-defined range. The key idea is to allow loops to depend on nonlinear mappings, conditional state evaluation, or recursive function outputs, thus generalizing the conventional concept of iteration.

This structure can serve as a didactic bridge between procedural control flow and functional programming paradigms, enabling students and researchers to model adaptive, nonlinear, or data-dependent iterations without resorting to external recursion or vectorization.

Applications include:

Adaptive simulation loops (e.g., step sizes depending on exponential or stochastic functions).

Nonlinear sampling in signal processing or numerical integration.

Pedagogical examples linking control flow to mathematical nonlinearity in computational education.

Future work may include extending this syntax into a language-level construct with an interpreter capable of handling functional iteration domains natively, such as for i = f(a) or loop(i ← f(a)).
